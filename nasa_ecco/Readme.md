The ["Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean" (ECCO)](https://ecco-group.org/) combines state-of-the-art ocean circulation models with global ocean data sets, makes the best possible estimates of ocean circulation and its role in climate change, including sea level rise, sea ice loss, El Niño events, and the cycling of water and carbon.

## ECCO Central Production Version 4 Release 4
[ECCO Version 4 release 4 (V4r4)](https://ecco-group.org/products-ECCO-V4r4.htm), covering the period 1992-2017, represents ECCO's latest ocean state estimate.

The ECCO v4 state estimate is the output of a free-running simulation of a global ca. 1-degree configuration of the [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org/).

[ECCO Version 4: release 5 (V4r5) (1992-2019)](https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/Version4/Release5/) is under working.
